# silent_auction
Silent auction webapp for a Unitarian Universalist Church, done as part of my Software Engineering class in Fall 2018.

This was done after the Apache/Python and Flask/Python failed. As it was an emergency situation, the app is fairly rudimentary, and not very elegant, but it got the job done and is good enough for being designed and developed completely in 5 hours.
